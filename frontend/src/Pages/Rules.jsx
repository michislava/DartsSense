            Darts is a game where players throw small missiles (darts) at a circular target (dartboard) from a distance of 7 feet 9.25 inches (2.37 meters) away. The objective varies depending on the game, but generally involves scoring points by hitting specific areas of the dartboard. Each player takes turns throwing three darts, aiming to accumulate points by strategically targeting high-scoring areas. Common winning conditions include reaching a target score, checking out to zero, or having the highest score after a set number of rounds. There are many variations of darts games, each with its own rules and scoring methods. Overall, darts requires skill, precision, and strategic decision-making to succeed.
